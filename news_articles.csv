The Tesla Analyst:  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained his 'outperform' rating and reduced Tesla's price target to $1,000 from $1,400.
The Tesla Thesis:  Strict Shanghai lockdowns have been an ""epic disaster"" thus far in the second quarter, Ives said in a note. 
The analyst sees modest delivery softness in the current quarter and a slower growth trajectory for Tesla in China in the second half.

Earnings news continues to be mixed and the uncertainty around the economic outlook could also weigh down on sentiment.
On Thursday, stocks opened lower but recovered in early trading and moved into the green, as traders digested mixed earnings and economic data on jobs, manufacturing and the housing market. Hawkish Fed speeches and the continued rise in bond yields generated selling pressure, dragging the indices back into negative terrain by mid-session.
The averages traded at depressed levels for the rest of the session before ending moderately lower.

Stocks snapped a two-session rally on Wednesday as rising bond yields stirred anxiety among traders. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.136%, marking the highest level since July 2008, underlining the recession fears among investors.
“A steady 3-month/10-year inversion would reinforce the Treasury market's signal that a recession is in the offing, since it has the reputation of predicting a serious economic downturn,” Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial said in a note.

Cues From Past Week’s Trading: 
Stocks advanced notably in the week ended Jan. 27, as the momentum picked up by the market earlIer this year accelerated, thanks to the hopes of a soft landing and few better-than-feared earnings. Better-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP data released in the past allayed fears of the economy falling off the cliff, while positive reaction to Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings and a rebound by energy prices also helped generate positive sentiment.

Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: 
Negative pressure on the U.S. Dollar and U.S. Treasury yields continued on Thursday, after the Bank of England hiked interest rates by 25bps to 4.25% and the ECB signaled ongoing increases in interest rates.
Expectations on future U.S. interest rates eased further, with money markets now assigning a greater probability to a hold in May (60%), while three 25-basis-point cuts are now fully priced until December 2023.
Dovish rate expectations by the market were sufficient to send all U.S. major stock indices higher during the session.

(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has seen an uneven recovery this year, alternating between recoveries and pullbacks. Much of the volatility may have to do with external shocks, including the banking crisis.
What Happened: Future Fund’s Gary Black,  a Tesla bull, weighed in on the near-term trajectory for the stock.
Tesla Price Action:  Tesla shares have lost about 12% since the March 1 Investor Day as opposed to the 4% gain for the Nasdaq 100 Index,  Black noted. The stock is still about 72% higher for the year, although off the year’s high of $217.65.

Over the past year, videos and photos surfaced of Cybertruck prototypes on the road or at facilities. Users have been able to question such things as the steel used in production, a giant windshield wiper blade and a new crash test facility.
One item people weren’t likely prepared to question was the Cybertruck getting stuck in the mud, which is what allegedly happened after the prototype appeared at the Texas groundbreaking event.
A user on Twitter (@stephfischer13) shared photos and a video from the event of the Tesla Cybertruck on the side of the road. The user alleged the pickup truck was stuck in a field.
“Couple hours after ground breaking on new Tesla lithium plant. Cybertruck got stuck in a south Texas field. Since they aren’t sold yet can only assume Mr. Musk was driving,” the Twitter user said.

The CPI data is one of the most crucial market-moving events for stocks, as investors try to decipher the state of the economy and how the Federal Reserve could respond next. 
How Is The Market Positioned Ahead Of April CPI? The consensus expectation from analysts is for the U.S. CPI inflation rate to hold at 5% annually in April, unchanged from March, while core inflation is predicted to slightly ease from 5.6% to 5.5%. The monthly increase for both headline and core inflation is expected to be at 0.4%.
Fed future swaps indicate investors currently assign an 88% probability of the Fed holding interest rates steady at 5-5.25% in June, as opposed to a 12% chance of a further 0.25% hike.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is widely expected to report its second-quarter deliveries on Sunday. An analyst at RBC Capital Markets expects quarterly deliveries to come in below the consensus estimate.
The Tesla Analyst: Tom Narayan has an Outperform rating and $305 price target for Tesla stock.
The Tesla Thesis
Q2 Expectation: Tesla's total second-quarter deliveries will likely come in at 438,000 units, Narayan said, citing his checks of regionally reported data and app download data. The estimated number would mark a 72% year-over-year increase and a 4% sequential estimate.
This compares to the company-compiled consensus estimate of 446,823 units. Future Fund's Gary Black said he expects second-quarter deliveries of 450,000 units, compared to FactSet's estimate of 445,000 units. China sales, according to the fund manager, would come in at 150,000 units.

S&P Global Ratings downgraded five U.S. regional banks, and has concurrently revised the outlook for two additional banks, a move that has stirred apprehension among participants in the market.
The move was largely attributed to hawkish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve.
Thomas Barkin, president of the Richmond Fed, underscored the situation, suggested that a scenario where inflation remains elevated and demand remains robust could trigger the need for a more stringent monetary policy.
As for Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), although it initially surged to achieve new all-time highs at the outset of the trading session, it promptly reversed course. The semiconductor giant is set to disclose its earnings after the market close on Wednesday.

Positive Sentiment
Please click here for a chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Note the following:

There is positive sentiment in the stock market in the early trade for a number of reasons explained below.
The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Nvidia stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows Nvidia's 8.47% gain on aggressive investor buying ahead of earnings that will be released tomorrow after the close. We shared with you various factors related to Nvidia in the prior Morning Capsule before most of the big rise yesterday.
The chart shows that Nvidia is up another 2.41% as of this writing in the premarket.
The chart shows the big rise in Nvidia when it reported earnings last quarter. Investors are expecting a similar rise Wednesday after the close.
The Arora Report very long term target on Nvidia was raised this morning. Other than that, there is no change in our prior call on Nvidia. We previously wrote:

In The Arora Report analysis, the demand for AI chips from Nvidia is far exceeding supply. As good as this sounds, the whisper numbers have moved up. Nvidia guided current quarter sales to $11B but whisper numbers are around $12B. A lot will also depend on what Nvidia guides for the current quarter that ends in October. Whisper numbers are around $12.5B.


Historically, it is common for a high flying stock to fall after great earnings because even great earnings often do not match high whisper numbers. To persuade their followers to buy Nvidia stock now before the earnings, momo gurus are preempting the possibility of Nvidia earnings coming below the high whisper numbers with a new mantra. The new mantra is even if Nvidia earnings are less than whisper numbers, it does not matter because the artificial intelligence frenzy will ultimately run the stock higher.
Wall Street is positioning for another leg up in the artificial intelligence frenzy rally.  Understanding positioning gives investors an edge. For those who are interested in learning about positioning, listen to the podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Positioning.”
Investors are also excited about stocks in Hong Kong rising about 2% within minutes.
In The Arora Report analysis, the 2% rise in Hong Kong stocks was most likely caused by the Chinese Plunge Protection Team (PPT) buying stocks through state entities. PPT is believed to be a secretive team inside the Chinese government with the responsibility to buy stocks to stop them from plunging.  Chinese learned from the U.S. The U.S. government is also believed to have ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Asia', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'Tech']",0.09206835799859056,2023-08-22,15:09:30

The topic of artificial intelligence is among the ""Big Ideas"" from Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest, but the ETF company says the days of Nvidia Corporation's (NASDAQ: NVDA) reign as the go-to AI investment may be waning.
What Happened: Shares of Nvidia are up over 200% year-to-date, as the company is seen as one of the major beneficiaries of growth in the artificial intelligence space. Wood and Ark Invest were previous investors in Nvidia, but sold their shares when they believed the valuation got too high.
Wood and Ark might be signaling Nvidia is hitting overvalued levels, calling for investors to look at small-cap companies instead.
“We believe the days of relying solely on mega-cap companies for tech innovation are waning and an era of AI-centric small-cap companies is emerging. Find out where we see potential growth opportunities built on AI,” Ark Invest tweeted Monday.
In a new report, Ark says that artificial intelligence could be a “long-term growth driver more impactful than the internet.”
The research report says that mega-cap technology stocks saw a rally on the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence possibilities, but this might be the wrong move for traders to make.
“We believe non-benchmark names are likely to accrue more value from AI over time.”

Avoiding Mega Caps: The research report said that benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), respectively, saw rallies led by artificial intelligence-linked names.

The U.S. government has become heavily reliant on Elon Musk's companies, such as SpaceX and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), in critical areas like space exploration, transportation and the future of energy.
SpaceX is the sole means of transporting NASA crew into space, and the government's plans for electric cars largely depend on Tesla, The New Yorker reports Monday. This dependency presents challenges, as Musk's risk-taking and capricious nature make him difficult to control.

Global Reactions Mount As Israel-Hamas Conflict Escalates
The week commenced with the eruption of conflict in the Middle East involving Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. 
President Joe Biden condemned Hamas’ attacks, labeling them an “act of sheer evil.” The White House has confirmed 27 deaths of American citizens. 
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken flew to Israel for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog, reaffirming U.S. support for Israel “as long as America exists.” 
Blinken also met with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Qatar Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in an effort to prevent the conflict from escalating further. Along the northern border between Israel and Lebanon, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah launched gunfire targeting several Israeli military posts. 
On Thursday, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva expressed concerns about how the conflict could impact global oil markets, as instability in the Middle East, responsible for roughly one-third of global oil production, could disrupt supplies.

A Thursday visit from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel was confirmation of unconditional support from the U.S. for Israel in its war against Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas.
Israel’s military reported on Thursday afternoon that over 1,200 people, including at least 27 Americans, have been killed by Hamas’ attacks, with around 2,800 individuals injured. In response to these attacks, Israeli counterstrikes in Gaza have resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,537 individuals, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, CBS News reported.
On Thursday morning, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva expressed concern over how the conflict could affect global oil markets, which are liable to be disrupted by war in the Middle East, where roughly a third of the global oil output is produced.
While the specific area where the conflict is located is not a significant oil-producing region, major disruptions in the global oil markets could come if further conflict arises between the U.S. and Iran, a long-time backer of Hamas operations against Israel. 
Earlier this week the Iranian government denied having any relationship with the Hamas attacks, as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""We defend Palestine, we defend the fights.""  This denial is contradicted by reports that Iran had a direct role in training Hamas for the latest attack on Israeli civilians, according to The Wall Street Journal.
While Congress is preparing a $2-billion aid package for Israel, several prominent U.S. politicians denounced Iran’s participation in the massacre, proposing a double-down on oil sanctions.

Hotter Consumer Inflation
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market ran up above the top band of the top support zone in anticipation of better than expected Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) as well as the market mechanics of year end chase and market positioning.
Yesterday, we shared with you that PPI came hotter than expected, but bullish investors chose to ignore it. Please read yesterday’s Capsules for more on PPI. Bullish investors chose to pin their hopes on CPI coming better than expected and market mechanics.
This morning, CPI came worse than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% month-over-month consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% month-over-month consensus. Of special note is that the whisper numbers for Core CPI were 0.2%. 
Wall Street was positioned for 0.2% Core CPI.


Now, there are two strikes against Wall Street positioning and bulls’ hopes in the form of PPI and CPI.
Stock futures were running up ahead of the release of CPI on hopes of better than expected numbers. On release of CPI, the stock market took a slight dip. The momo crowd aggressively bought the dip and is trying to run up the stock market as of this writing.
In The Arora Report analysis, even though progress is being made on inflation, core inflation is staying sticky, way above the Fed’s 2% target. This means that the Fed is likely to keep rates higher for longer but may be reluctant to raise rates. You may recall that The Arora Report’s call for a while has been that core inflation will stay sticky. So far, that call is spot on.
Earnings season starts tomorrow, although a fair number of earnings were reported this morning. Earnings are expected to be inline with consensus; however, earnings this morning are mixed.
Going forward, bulls’ faith in market mechanics to run up the stock market will be tested as their predictions on the data have been wrong.
Here are the probabilities of Fed interest rate hikes:

10% in November
33% in December


Initial jobless claims came at 209K vs. 214K consensus. This indicates that the job picture, especially at the low end, remains very strong. The job ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas']",0.12771756978653528,2023-10-12,15:27:30

Hotter Producer Inflation
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA: SPY)  which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market moved up above the top band of the top support zone. The move up was driven primarily by market mechanics.
Bulls are confident that market mechanics will drive the stock market to the mini resistance zone shown on the chart.
Bulls have data to back up their belief. About two thirds of the market rise this year is due to market mechanics. Market mechanics tend to become extra powerful in November and December. Bulls are also pointing to the historical data that shows that the year end chase is to the upside in a year when the stock market has been up more than 10% going into the last quarter. Of course, prudent investors need to take into account the current conditions that are unique to this year. All investors should strive to develop deep knowledge of market mechanics to gain a big edge. Due to the high value, Wall Street professionals keep the details of market mechanics close to their chest. The best way to learn about market mechanics is to listen to the podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club.
Producer Price Index came hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.5% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus.


Wall Street has been positioned for better than expected PPI and CPI. Today PPI has dashed bulls’ hopes, but they are hanging tough, trusting that market mechanics will drive the stock market higher irrespective of the data.
CPI will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET. The latest consensus is 0.3% for both the headline and core.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly commented that the neutral rate may now be at 3%. Stock market bulls are still hoping for ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas']",0.18689300411522633,2023-10-11,14:46:36

When asked if he liked his car, the owner initially hesitated but eventually conceded, “Sure, it’s great.” 
However, his reluctance to buy another Tesla became evident as he explained, “No… I will wait for the price to drop more, or other EV options to come out before buying another TSLA.” 
He appreciated the car and its software but voiced concerns about pricing and depreciation. He also felt that the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package was “too much at $15K; I’m not rich.”

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is gearing up to reveal its third-quarter financial performance, and analysts are bracing for the report and subsequent earnings call.
Scheduled for release next week, on Oct. 18, Tesla’s results come amidst a backdrop of price reductions and sluggish vehicle sales. Here’s what two analysts anticipate for the forthcoming report:
Will Musk Blame Economic Woes? Tesla’s stock has faced a downward trend following earnings releases over recent quarters, with declines occurring in seven of the past 12 quarters, according to Future Fund Managing Director Gary Black. He attributed this to concerns surrounding earnings quality and negative management commentary during conference calls.
Earnings quality concerns include factors like regulatory credits, non-operating income, or low tax rates.
The consensus estimate for Tesla’s earnings per share stands at $0.75, a decrease from the initial estimate of $0.78 before third-quarter deliveries were disclosed. According to Black, the most crucial metric this quarter is the auto gross margin, excluding regulatory credits. While the Street estimate pegs this figure at 18%, Black’s projection is 17.1%.

Positioning
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows that QQQ bounced from the top band of the mini support zone. This is a sign of strength for tech stocks.
The chart shows that unlike S&P 500 (SPX) SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY), QQQ did not even come close to the 200 day moving average. This is again a sign of relative strength of tech stocks.
The chart shows that RSI has quickly gone from oversold to overbought. This is due to the market mechanics of year end chase taking over.
Important inflation data is ahead.

PPI will be released on October 11 at 8:30am ET. Consensus for the headline is 0.3% and for core is 0.2%.
CPI will be released on October 12 at 8:30am ET. Consensus for both the headline and core is 0.3%.


In The Arora Report analysis, Wall Street is positioned for inflation numbers better than the consensus. Those interested in learning deeply about market mechanics of positioning, listen to the podcast “MARKET MECHANICS: POSITIONING.”

If the numbers come better than the consensus, Wall Street will be encouraged that they called it right. This will cause aggressive buying.
If the numbers come worse than the consensus, expect smart money to lightly sell and the market mechanic of year end chase to temporarily pause. Expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks.


The International Monetary Fund is raising its projections for inflation to 5.8% for the next year. Only three months ago, the IMF had made a project of 5.2%. In The Arora Report analysis, this is not good news: however as of this writing the crowd is oblivious as market mechanics have taken over.
There is plenty of Fed speak today that may move the markets, speakers include Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari, Christopher Waller, and Mary Daly. Investors are hoping that the Fed speakers will say the following:

What Happened: A report by the Wall Street Journal sheds light on the trade barriers set up by the federal government, which have effectively limited the presence of these affordable EVs in the American automotive landscape.
Initiated by former President Donald Trump, the 25% tariff on Chinese auto imports has been a significant hurdle. This policy was further reinforced by President Joe Biden, who also excluded Chinese EVs from the advantageous ""Buy America"" credits.
These measures have created a challenging environment for Chinese automakers to compete in the U.S., contrasting with their growing market presence elsewhere.
Despite these obstacles, the global influence of Chinese automakers continues to expand, raising concerns among U.S. officials about the long-term effectiveness of these trade barriers.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) managed to post a weekly gain but settled off the highs, as the pre-Cybertruck launch frenzy soured amid mixed reviews for the electric pickup truck.
Here are the key events that happened in the EV space during the week:
Tesla’s Cybertruck Launch, Swedish Strike Update And More: After four years of its unveiling, Tesla’s Cybertruck finally saw the light of the day. The company held a grand delivery event Thursday afternoon at its Giga Austin facility and handed over the first few vehicles to customers. Delving into the details Tesla made available on its website, most analysts said the EV pickup truck was pricier.
Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster, who is bullish on Tesla, said the final pricing of the three trim levels was at least 20-25% above his expectations. He also said the Cybertruck will likely be a “side story” until the company fully ramps up production to an annual production rate of 25,000 units in 2026.

Technology stocks, as closely monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), outpaced broader market gains, with the Nasdaq 100 index escalating by 10.8%, recording its fifth-best monthly result in a decade.
Additionally, bond markets rallied as yields took a notable dip, while metal commodities thrived in the wake of a weakening dollar.
Fueling this broad market rally was a surge in investor optimism, anticipating Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 in response to cooling inflation. Speculative bets are now leaning towards the Fed commencing its rate-cutting cycle in March 2024, with up to five rate reductions by the end of next year.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq indices are all set for their fifth consecutive week of positive movement. Investor optimism further improved, driven by growing speculation of Fed rate cuts in 2024, despite Fed Chair Powell’s cautious remarks.
The ISM manufacturing activity slowed more than predicted in November, contributing to a marked drop in Treasury yields. 
According to CME Group Fed Watch tool, fed futures are currently anticipating the first interest rate cut in March 2024, with a probability of 60%. Furthermore, speculators are factoring in a total of five rate cuts by December 2024, with a probability of 72%.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell 0.4%, partially erasing Thursday’s gain. Gold, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), continued to shine, with the precious metal surging by 1.5% to reach $2,070 per ounce, coming tantalizingly close to its all-time highs.

December, typically a seasonally strong month, could be cautiously approached by traders as the major averages have all advanced strongly this year despite the economic uncertainties. That said, if incoming evidence continues to support expectations of a soft landing scenario accompanied by a cool-off in inflation, then cash waiting on the sidelines will likely be into stocks and other risky bets, increasing the momentum of the typical “Santa Claus” rally.
Traders could closely watch Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s two public appearances as they seek clarity on the rate outlook.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
The major indices closed mixed on Thursday, as profit-taking in some high-profile tech names weighed down on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, while the Dow Industrials advanced solidly. The strong gain of the 30-stock blue-chip average was fueled by the 9%+ rally in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) shares following its quarterly results. The breadth markedly favored the advancers, with 24 of the index components closing in the green.
A tamer reading for the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge also kept the risk appetite alive.
The broader S&P 500 Index, which traded below the unchanged line for the bulk of the session, recovered in a last-hour push upward.

Analysts Harp On Disappointing Pricing: At the current production level, Tesla could be losing $40,000 on each vehicle, said Deepwater Asset Management co-founder Gene Munster in a CNBC interview late Thursday. The loss will likely narrow when the company gets to the scale of making 10,000 units, he said.
“I’ve been waiting for this for four years. I was disappointed today in the price,” the fund manager said, adding “I have a reservation [but] I don’t know if I’m going to get it,” he added.
In a separate video posted on X, formerly Twitter, Munster said pricing across the trim levels was 20-25% higher than what he expected. The high-end trim, namely the Cyber Beast, and the all-wheel drive versions are priced at $99,000 and $80,000, respectively, and the single-motor rear-wheel drive, which will be available in 2025, has a price tag of $61,000, he noted. 
Compared with Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE:F) F-150 Lightning, Munster said each of Blue Oval’s versions is around $10,000 lower. That said, the analyst sees the Cybertruck as a superior product. It’s about 15%-20% longer, is more durable, and has better performance, he said.

The entry-level, single-motor, rear-wheel-drive (RWD) version was initially slated to start at $39,900 with an estimated range of 250 miles per charge. The dual-motor all-wheel-drive (AWD) variant was projected to begin at $49,900, and the top-tier tri-motor all-wheel drive at $69,900, offering a range exceeding 500 miles.

Analysts at Wedbush said that price cuts in 2023 were the right move to ensure healthy demand given increasing competition and higher production rates.
However, they questioned whether the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker can continue its cost-cutting strategies, or if it will opt to keep its current pricing to ensure margin stability amid possible declines in EV demand.
“Which pricing path Tesla takes will be a foundational move for the future of Tesla over the coming years in our view,” said analyst Daniel Ives.
Wedbush kept its outperform rating on Tesla stock and maintained a $350 price target.

What Happened: Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cut his estimates for Tesla, citing expectations for a challenging year for electric vehicles.
He reduced the 2024 adjusted earnings per share estimate from $2.41 to $1.98, down from the $3.02 per share estimated for 2023. 
Morgan Stanley’s price target dropped from $380 to $345, with reductions attributed to lower volume, average transaction price, and margins in the core auto business, as well as lower valuation for Tesla Mobility and Network Services and a cut to the valuation of Tesla Insurance, Battery, and Energy businesses.

Earnings could exert a significant influence on stocks and the market this week, overshadowing economic data. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) are among the key companies set to release earnings reports, likely capturing investors’ attention.
Traders will receive data on the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge, specifically the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index, on Friday. This number could be crucial as it is expected to shape investor expectations regarding the upcoming rate decision on Jan. 31.
Cues From Last Week's Trading:
Stocks closed the holiday-shortened week ending Jan. 19 on a positive note. Traders overcame early-week jitters caused by some Federal Reserve officials and economic data that dampened hopes of rate cuts. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (NYSE:TSM) strong outlook attracted buyers back into the market on Thursday. This positive sentiment drove the S&P 500 Index to a record high in Friday’s session.
LPL Financial Chief Global Strategist Quincy Krosby noted, “As technology, semiconductors, and consumer discretionary led the S&P 500 to new highs, it reflected the strength of the growth sectors that underpinned the inherent strength in the bull market that was born earlier last year.”

The firm’s deputy CIO, Dan Suzuki, believes that the current market signals could lead to a significant shift in investment dynamics.
What Happened: Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA) has been signaling a potential investment opportunity amidst concerning signs in the stock market, reported Business Insider. The firm has been predicting a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity for months, and it appears to be on the verge of realization.
According to RBA’s Deputy CIO Dan Suzuki, the market’s current situation, particularly the dominance of a few stocks, could lead to a broader market shift. The firm’s thesis, proposed at the end of last year, suggests that the extraordinary market leadership of a small group of stocks will expand to the wider market, resulting in stronger gains for the other 493 S&P 500 stocks.
However, Suzuki warned that the corporate earnings of major tech companies are expected to decelerate in the next quarter.

Ahead of the results, a venture capitalist and Tesla bull Gene Munster weighed on the aspects that will likely be on investors’ radar.
Margin Is The Key: There is risk to the consensus core auto margin estimate of 17.1% for the December quarter due to the ramp in Cybertruck, said Munster, Managing Partner at Deepwater Asset Management. He expects core auto margin, which excludes regulatory credits, to come in at 16.7%, up from 16.3% in the September quarter. 
Despite the decline, Munster said this is a “directional positive” as it would end Tesla’s four-quarter declining margin streak. He noted that margins peaked seven quarters ago at 29%, and despite the contraction seen since then, Tesla has outperformed the other automakers with 10-14% gross margin. 
Munster expects CFO Vaibhav Taneja to guide to stable margins during 2024. He, however, sees core auto margins to come in at 17-18%, below the current consensus of about 18.5%. Long term, the analyst sees operating margins trending at 25% or greater.

After a strong recovery for its stock in 2023, Tesla shares have turned into one of the worst performers over the last three months.
What Happened: The S&P 500 Index has been setting new all-time high records in 2024 passing the 5,000 level.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the index, is up 33.6% over the last year and up 8.3% year-to-date in 2024. The index and ETF have been helped by the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.
The seven stocks of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla have helped boost the S&P 500 over the last year.
Year-to-date though, two of the seven key stocks are negative with Apple down 9.9% and Tesla down 34.4%. Overall, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is up 8.3% year-to-date in 2024.
Turns out Tesla isn't just underperforming as a member of the Magnificent 7, the stock is also underperforming in the S&P 500 Index.

Traders received a cold shower on Thursday as hopes for a rate cut were dashed, with February’s Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation figure significantly exceeding expectations, adding to concerns raised by robust consumer inflation data earlier in the week.
During morning trading hours in New York, major U.S. equity indices turned negative, driven by a sharp increase in U.S. Treasury yields.
The 30-year Treasury note yields rose by 9 basis points to 4.44%, marking the highest level since late February. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT), the world’s largest bond ETF, declined by 1.4%, poised for its sixth consecutive day of losses, marking the longest losing streak since last August.
Traders tempered their expectations for rate cuts, now anticipating only an 80-basis-point reduction by year-end, equating to just three cuts of 25 basis points each.

Hotter PPI

Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is staying above the trendline.
As long as the stock market stays above the trendline, the momo crowd is going to continue to buy stocks.
The data just released shows that the momo crowd is in AI la la land and paying no attention to the data. 
The Arora Report has been heavily focused on AI, and as a result, Arora portfolios have done extremely well. Having said that, prudent investors need to understand that when it is all said and done, AI has to prosper in the real world and not in a make believe artificial world.  Right now, the momo crowd is in AI la la land. 
Producer Price Index (PPI) shows that inflation is running hotter at the producer level than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.6% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus.


PPI feeds directly into PCE, which is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. The data released today shows that the Fed needs to be very careful before cutting rates.
As The Arora Report had correctly predicted, consumer spending is beginning to weaken. The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. For this reason, prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. Here is the latest retail sales data.

Headline retail sales came at 0.6% vs. 0.7% consensus.
Retail sales ex-auto came at 0.3% vs. 0.5% consensus.

Bond yields, however, tell a different story, and have been on an uptrend in recent sessions.
Cues From Previous Session:
The lack of any major catalyst kept sentiment subdued on Wednesday, with tech stocks serving as drags. The major averages opened on a mixed note, with the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Index declining, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher at the open. 
The former two indices languished mostly below the unchanged line before ending lower, while the Dow held above the unchanged line for a majority of the session before ending modestly higher. The 30-stock blue-chip average received support from a strong rally in 3M Co. (NYSE:MMM) after the company announced a new CEO. 
IT, real estate, healthcare, and consumer discretionary stocks experienced weakness, while energy and material stocks were among the biggest gainers.

Analyst Color:
Delving into the reasons behind the market’s optimism since the October 2023 lows, Morgan Stanley’s Lisa Shalett said easy financial conditions and excitement about AI are driving the surge, despite persistently high rates and negative earnings revisions. 
The analyst, however, cautioned against investors pinning much hope on these going forward. Liquidity infusion into the financial system from banks, money markets, and government stimulus programs that more than offset Fed tightening may finally be drying up and excess savings cushions are nearing exhaustion, she said.

With nearly 2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel and over 339,000 followers on X, Paffrath expressed his frustration, saying, “But I feel stabbed in the back and a lot of it doesn’t even have to do with Tesla, has to do with what I think the Federal Reserve is about to do to us.” He clarified that his short position is only for the short term.

(NASDAQ:TSLA), suggesting a shift in market sentiment. Ives noted the pervasive bearish outlook, even among New York City cab drivers, but predicted a significant rebound for Tesla in the coming years, especially with advancements in AI technology.
What Happened: On Wednesday, Ives acknowledged the current “piling on” by bears emerging “out of hibernation,” yet he maintains a long-term bullish stance on the electric vehicle (EV) giant. He believes that the current sentiment will be viewed retrospectively as a prime buying opportunity for investors.
“When you look through in six to nine months, we are going to look at this as more of a golden buying opportunity for Tesla over the next two to three years, especially with AI, right in time to throw in the white towel. But for now, we all know that even the New York City cab driver is bearish on Tesla,” he told to CNBC.

AI Frenzy
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

QQQ is above the trendline shown on the chart.
The chart shows that QQQ ran up in spite of hotter inflation data. Yesterday, gamma squeeze and AI frenzy completely overpowered inflation data that was negative for the stock market.
Prudent investors know the market cannot ignore inflation forever. While the stock market and the economy are not the same thing, they can not be completely divorced from one another.
As long as QQQ stays above the trendline shown on the chart, the rapidly increasing YOLO (you only live once) behavior in the stock market will continue. In YOLO behavior, investors give up any notion of risk.
The chart shows that if QQQ starts pulling back, the major support zone is far off.
Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL) earnings indicated there is a strong demand for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips.
NVDA stock ran up on Oracle earnings, which pulled up other AI stocks and led the market higher.
Quadruple witching is this Friday. Quadruple witching is to the upside.
The incessant call buying by the momo crowd is leading to a gamma squeeze, putting upward pressure on the stock market. Gamma squeeze is an important market mechanic. Understanding gamma squeeze can give investors an edge.
NVDA has now totally replaced Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as the momo crowd’s favorite stock. The momo crowd is selling TSLA and buying NVDA.
The next major trigger for the stock market will be the Nvidia GTC event that starts on March 18.
The momo crowd is caught up in the AI frenzy to such a large extent that the momo crowd has decided inflation does not matter anymore.

Stock futures point to a flattish open on Wednesday. The absence of any major catalysts could increase indecision although traders may look forward to the reception to the 30-year bond auction, given the slight recovery in bond yields in recent sessions. 
Strategists, meanwhile, are optimistic that the market would preserve the upward momentum, baking in expectations that the Federal Reserve has to pause sometime this year.  Between now and the upcoming Wednesday’s Fed decision, stocks could mostly tread water before making a decisive move in either direction.
Cues From Previous Session:
U.S. stocks ended Tuesday’s session on an upbeat note as traders ignored the message relayed by the February inflation and the rise in bond yields. The major averages opened higher after consumer price inflation came in hotter than expected. Selling emerged immediately after, dragging the indices into negative territory in early trading.
The averages staged a remarkable recovery as commentary from economists after the data release suggested that the downward trend in underlying inflation is intact. After a V-shaped recovery in late-morning trading, they moved roughly sideways before ending notably higher.
The broader S&P 500 Index closed at a fresh record after hitting an intraday high earlier in the session, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Industrials closed short of their respective records.
“Hopes remain that even though we continue to be far from the Fed’s 2% target they will still make cuts, believing that a lower Fed Funds rate will still keep sufficient pressure on inflation to move eventually towards 2%,” said fund manager Louis Navellier.

TARK is an actively managed double-leveraged ETF aiming to return 200% of the daily performance of Cathie Wood-led ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK).
ARKK, and subsequently TARK, have been buoyed recently by the Bitcoin rally because Coinbase Global, Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) is the largest holding within Wood’s ARKK fund, weighted at 10.91%.
Coinbase’s strong 124% rally between Feb. 7 and Tuesday has helped hold ARKK and TARK within a consolidation pattern while ARKK’s other two top holdings, Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Roku, Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU) have underperformed this year, falling about 30% each since trading started on Jan. 2.

Rivian will offer two battery sizes with the R2 platform. The larger battery will offer more than 300 miles of range and RBC expects the smaller battery and lower-priced vehicle to have a range of about 250 miles.
The EV maker plans to shift production of the R2 to its Normal, Illinois facility — where the R1 is produced — instead of using its Georgia facility, where the R3 will be produced.

Hotter Inflation 
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is hovering above the trendline.
The chart shows when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was last reported, the stock market fell as CPI was hotter than expected.
The difference between when CPI was reported last time as shown on the chart and the CPI release this time is that stock market euphoria has significantly expanded.  
The chart shows that the stock market is rising after the CPI report today.
CPI came hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.
Core CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.


On a micro level, the stock market quickly dipped after the release of the hotter than expected CPI, but then the momo crowd stepped in to aggressively buy the dip.
If the stock market was in a rational phase, it would have seen a big drop today on the hotter than expected CPI. However, the stock market is in a euphoric phase. In a euphoric phase, bad news is good news, and good news is great news. A characteristic of the euphoric phase is that all news is bought, irrespective of what it is.  
Momo gurus have a new highly flawed narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The narrative is that year-over-year inflation came at 3.2% vs. 3.1% consensus.
As we have shared with you several times along the way, looking solely at year-over-year is like driving while looking only in the rearview mirror. Investors should look at month-over-month for the last three months – this is like looking through the windshield. Investors should also look at year-over-year, but that is like looking through the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Economics', 'Markets', 'General']",0.08081955922865013,2024-03-12,15:00:04

What Happened: Gianarikas attributes the stock’s current lag to the company’s dismal earnings revisions over the past 12-plus months.

What Happened: The S&P 500 has delivered its strongest first quarter since 2019, despite an 11% drop in Apple’s shares and a nearly 30% fall in Tesla’s stock. A report from The Wall Street Journal highlights the emergence of a new tech quartet, consisting of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has been pivotal in driving the broader market’s performance.
Investor sentiment is buoyed by hopes that the economy may skirt a severe recession and anticipations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The burgeoning excitement around artificial intelligence technologies has also played a role in bolstering market optimism.
""The fact that the market is still holding these levels and trading up without that full force of the Magnificent Seven is actually a really positive thing,"" said Joseph Ferrara, investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers.

What Happened: Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla suffered double-digit declines in the first three months of the year, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
The other Mag7 stocks include Nvidia, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).
Among these companies, Nvidia’s stock has soared the highest, spiking 85% over the first quarter this year. Tesla’s stock, meanwhile, has struggled to maintain momentum, marking a notable shift in market dynamics. It’s down 20%.

Chart: Benzinga Pro
Nvidia, known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, saw its stock rise by 245% in 2023. Shares continued their ascent in 2024. Nvidia’s stock is up about 85% YTD.

The price consumption expenditure index released Friday showed that the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose in line with expectations. Although Fed Chair Powell said on Friday that the central bank wasn’t in a hurry to cut rates, the market has begun discounting downward rate adjustments, beginning in June. 
Commenting on the data, Jeffery Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial said, “The trajectory for consumer spending is weakening, especially since real disposable incomes declined in February. Core services inflation is slowing and will likely continue throughout the year.”
“By the time the Fed meets in June, the data should be convincing enough for them to commence it's rate normalization process.”
Cues From Previous Week
U.S. stocks closed the holiday-shortened week ended March 28 on a mixed note, with the tech stocks reporting modest losses for the week, while the broader S&P 500 Index and the Dow Industrials recorded gains. The latter two ended at fresh record highs.
After starting the previous week on a weak note amid profit-taking after the Fed meeting, stocks showed lackluster sentiment yet again on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they snapped a three-session losing streak and advanced solidly before ending the final trading session on a mixed note.

Electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is expected to report first-quarter productions and delivery figures next week, which could show a sequential decline from the fourth quarter and a drop after a record-setting year.
Here are what analysts are expecting for Tesla in the first quarter.
Q1 Delivery Estimates: Citing concerns like electric vehicle demand, China and macroeconomic concerns, analysts have been cutting their first-quarter delivery estimates for Tesla.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives recently cut his price target on Tesla from $315 to $300 and cut his estimate for first-quarter and full-year deliveries.
""Let's call it like it is: 1Q deliveries has been a nightmare quarter for Tesla as China demand remains very soft coming out of the gates for 2024,"" Ives said.
Ives said Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers ""will not be a moment of celebration for the bulls.""

How long will the party last? What are the risks involved in investing in an overbought market? Benzinga collated views from analysts and economists to make sense of the rally so far and zero in on the opportunities that could pay off in the near to medium term.
Equity Market — From Shaky Start To Strong Surge: The equity market kicked off the new year with a whimper, with concerns that 2023’s gains might not hold. However, the momentum from last year carried through, quashing skepticism and propelling the market to new highs.
Three months in, the S&P 500 Index has notched record highs for both closing and intraday trading. Blue-chip stocks mirrored this performance, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing the quarter at a fresh record. 
Tech stocks were once again at the forefront, fueled by the AI boom that spurred gains for companies of all sizes. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite couldn’t quite reach its record peak as valuation concerns prompted some profit-taking near the quarter’s end.

                               Source: Benzinga 
The more heartening aspect of the recent rally is that, unlike in 2023 when it was nearly exclusively fueled by tech, this time around, the participation has broadened. 
LPL Financial‘s Chief Technical Strategist, Adam Turnquist, said in a recent note that the strong uptrend in the S&P 500 Index is supported by broad participation and cyclical leadership. “Improving relative strength in industrials, financials, and materials provides additional evidence of a bullish rotation that has largely been overshadowed by mega-caps and AI enthusiasm,” he said.

AI optimism drove much of the upside early in the quarter, with stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) — the ones at the forefront of the revolution — clocking strong gains for the year. In the latter half, stocks received support from the Fed leaning toward rate cuts.","['Long Ideas', 'News', 'Analyst Color', 'Equities', 'Short Sellers', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Education', 'Commodities', 'Top Stories', 'Analyst Ratings', 'Tech', 'Trading Ideas']",0.11977644751082252,2024-03-29,06:24:23

Presently, Black views the FSD software as a remarkable driver assist tool rather than a fully autonomous driving solution. He stated that for the software to truly deliver autonomous driving capabilities, Tesla must assume full liability for any injury or damage incurred.

The Tesla Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and cut his price target from $315 to $300. 
Twin Troubles: Tesla has been haunted by both demand and supply-side issues, said Ives in a note. The first quarter has been nightmarish for Tesla as China demand remained very soft from the beginning of the quarter, and factory planned downtimes and the Berlin fire have impacted supply, he said.
“There is no denying this has been a quarter to forget for Musk and Tesla,” the analyst said. 
The weakness may have been exacerbated by the Model 3 Highland upgrade issues in the Fremont factory and flattish sales in Europe, he added.
As such, the analyst reduced his first-quarter delivery estimates from 475,000 units to 425,000 units, citing a “perfect storm” of demand issues that hit the quarter, which in turn hurt delivery and sales.
