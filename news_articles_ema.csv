What Happened: Talking to Brian Sullivan during CNBC’s “Last Call,” Higgins described how Musk’s visit to China will play out with investors.
“Serious Elon was on display, and serious Elon is clearly what investors are looking for. They are so starved for Elon’s attention that they are just ecstatic since the last week,” he said.
Higgins pointed out that this was due to Musk’s visible seriousness during the earnings call. His latest visit to China also sends a message to the Chinese market that “Tesla has the endorsement of the government.” This is an important development since Tesla has often faced skepticism and restrictions from the country. 
Sullivan also added that “Musk needs the blessing of Beijing.”

Cues From The Last Session:
Stocks closed Monday’s session on a positive note, although trading was marked by some degree of volatility. The major indices opened the session higher, as the positive momentum from Friday carried over into the new week, with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading from the front. They stayed above the unchanged line for the better part of the morning before reversing course in late afternoon trading.
While apprehension ahead of the week’s key earnings and data was attributed to the weakness, the stock recovered thereafter to close higher for a second straight session. Market participants also blamed the intraday slide on an increase in the U.S. Treasury’s June quarter borrowing estimates.
The gains were led by consumer discretionary stocks, while communication services stocks dragged.

The S&P 500 retraced 0.9% after a 2-day positive streak, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slightly underperforming, down 1.1%. Small caps suffered larger losses, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) down 1.5%. 
The stock market faced renewed pressure as economic data revealed a decline in consumer confidence and persistent wage pressures, putting further pressures on the Federal Reserve. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 1.2% increase in the employment cost index for the first quarter of 2024, surpassing market expectations of 1% growth and accelerating from the previous three-month period’s 0.9% rise. In April, the Conference Board consumer confidence index dropped from 103.1 to 97 points, falling short of forecasts for a rise to 104.
Bonds provided little refuge to investors as yields surged in response to comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who voiced concerns about the deficit trajectory and proposed substantial measures to address budgetary gaps.

Further, Murphy added that TSLA would benefit should EV demand recover.

Recent reports indicated that Tesla received China’s approval to launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology in the country. 
China is the world’s largest automotive market in terms of new vehicle sales, and if confirmed, this approval will enable TSLA to deploy its FSD driver-assistance system there. 
Murphy added that TSLA is also the only Western manufacturer to have been included in China’s list of companies that meet automotive data security requirements alongside domestic manufacturers.

China FSD: A Big Boost, But Questions Remain
While Black acknowledges the difficulty of quantifying FSD’s value for Tesla, he emphasizes two key factors:

Sales Model: Will Tesla sell FSD only on its own vehicles, or will it secure licensing deals with Chinese startups?
Adoption Rate: How many Tesla owners in China will opt for FSD?

“It's difficult to quantify what FSD approval in China is worth to $TSLA valuation. Much depends on whether TSLA sells FSD on just its own vehicles or secures licensing deals with other China EV makers. Much also depends on China's FSD take rate,” he posted on X.
Black highlighted the significant electric vehicle (BEV) market in China, which sells 22 million vehicles annually, with 24% (roughly 5.2 million) being BEVs.

(NASDAQ:TSLA).
What Happened: Higgins suggested that Musk’s decision to downsize, while potentially justified due to market demand issues, reveals flaws in his leadership. 
“The part that is showing cracks in his leadership style is this cultural immaturity around some of his behaviour,” Higgins said on CNBC‘s “Last Call” on Wednesday.
He elaborated that layoffs often leave a cultural insecurity and employees tend to underperform when they are constantly worried about getting laid off.

In contrast, Jefferies has revised its 12-month forecast for Tesla downward, suggesting a potential decline of nearly 7% in the electric vehicle manufacturer’s share value.
Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore has set Nvidia’s price target at $1,000, up from $795, attributing this optimism to strong demand and pricing power in the semiconductor space. Moore specifically pointed to Nvidia’s Data Center segment as a primary growth catalyst, driven by increasing needs for AI/ML hardware.

Raise Cash
It is time to increase cash by 4%. Hedges were recently raised. Please see the protection band section below.
The bull market is intact, but the probability of a pullback has gone up. As full disclosure, the tentative plan for The Arora Report is to buy the pullback.  
Hotter Inflation 
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has broken the upward sloping trendline that has defined the rally.
The chart shows the Arora call to raise hedges prior to the drop.
The chart shows the support zone from which the breakout occurred. The tentative plan is to buy if the stock market pulls back to the support zone. However, this will need to be adjusted – read the next point.
The probability of the stock market pulling back to the support zone is less than 50%. The reason is that the buy the dip crowd is already aggressively buying the dip and is prepared to aggressively buy more.  
The new data shows that inflation is hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.


As a reference, the new data equates to inflation at an annualized rate of 4.8%. The Fed’s target is 2%.
In The Arora Report analysis, this time, the momo gurus are going to have difficulty persuading their followers to buy stocks. One reason is that momo gurus have been wrong at every step of the way this year.  Having said that, do not underestimate the cleverness of momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to persuade investors to buy stocks.  At the same time, do not underestimate the power of greed in the momo crowd. The momo crowd is very easy to influence because at best, the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Commodities', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'General']",TSLA,0.10819776714513556,15:36:37,0.13282631322394006

Note the following:

Oil is most sensitive to developments in the Middle East.
The chart shows that oil is falling after an Iranian attack on Israel.
The chart shows that oil is consolidating around the upper trendline.
The best of all scenarios is playing out in the Middle East.

Although there are contradictory reports, it is near certain that Iran informed Turkey and Turkey informed the U.S. of the Iranian attack in advance.
The reason Iran informed the U.S. in advance is because Iran’s purpose was to show force and save face but not inflict much damage and for the U.S. to restrain Israel.
The advance notice allowed the U.S. and Israel to shoot down 99% of about 300 drones and missiles, resulting in very little damage.
Iran issued several statements that the operation was concluded.
Biden is working hard to restrain Israel.
Not only is oil down, stocks are being aggressively bought on the best Middle East scenario being played out.


In The Arora Report analysis, Iran’s response to directly attack Israel has increased risks in the long term, especially without a robust response from Israel.
Further, in The Arora Report analysis, Iran is buying time to build its nuclear capability.

As full disclosure, Apple is in the ZYX Buy Model Portfolio from The Arora Report and is long from $4.68. The prior Arora call has been to hedge the Apple position. Stay tuned for the plan on hedges and the potential change in the buy zone.

“I remember when this would have mattered,” Scott Nations, founder of Nations Indexes, said on social media following the announcement.

While Tesla’s performance recently has severely lagged behind the six other Magnificent Seven stocks, a reversal has been taking place, which could set the EV giant on a larger rebound because the stock is trading in a triangle pattern and has developed hidden bullish divergence.
For traders hoping to profit from a potential reversal to the upside in Tesla, single-stock ETFs could provide a solid return.

Wood saw a potential growth industry in AI for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earlier than many.
The bad news for Wood and investors in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) is the popular ETF sold out of its position too early and missed the current huge increase in price for Nvidia shares.
What Happened: Over the years, Wood has been known to hold stocks and call for five-to-10-year outlooks instead of short-term trading. Artificial intelligence has been a big idea from the fund management company in recent years.
The Ark Innovation ETF invested in Nvidia on several occasions before selling out of its position completely in January 2023 after selling a large portion beginning in November 2022.
Today, those original shares would be worth significantly more than when sold.
Wood recalled investing in Nvidia early during an interview on Benzinga's ""The Raz Report."" Wood said Ark Invest was ""there"" when Nvidia was in the early growth stages and mentioned a brainstorming session that led to buying shares in 2014 back at a price point of around $5.

Opportunities Ahead But Be Astute
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Plenty of opportunities are ahead in 2024, but you need to be astute as to when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy if you want market beating returns.  
The chart shows that during the Santa Claus rally, the stock market did not hit the top band of the resistance zone. In the very short term, this is a negative.
The chart shows the stock market has pulled back to the low band of the resistance zone. To maintain bullish posture, the stock market needs to not go much below the bottom band of the resistance zone.
There are likely many stops right below the bottom band of the resistance zone.  If the stock market starts dropping, hunt and destroy algorithms will go into action and take out the stops. This is the reason that The Arora Report recommends not placing stops at obvious points.
Historically, after the stops are taken out, there is a bounce. Officially, the period for the Santa Claus rally will end at the close tomorrow.
RSI shown on the chart is on a sell signal, but the pattern is such that it can quickly reverse to a buy signal.
RSI on the chart shows negative divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI and the price are moving differently. This is a negative in the very short term.
In the early trade this morning, there is considerable tax related selling. Historically, such selling is common after a strong year. The reason is that investors did not want to sell in 2023 to avoid paying capital gains taxes for the 2023 tax year.  By selling now, they have successfully postponed paying capital gains tax by one year.
As the year starts, investors are again making the classic mistake that we warned you about late last year. The classic mistake investors make at this time of the year is to act on the following:

2024 year end targets from Wall Street strategists
Sector recommendations from Wall Street strategists


In our 40 years in the markets, a vast majority of the time, Wall Street strategists are wrong. To understand the recent history, consider the following:

Right now, investors are worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears.
In 2023 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabears and deriding permabulls. What did the stock market do? The stock market went up.
In 2022 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears. What did the stock market do? The stock market went down.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) reported Tuesday above-consensus deliveries for the fourth quarter (Q4) and, in the process, reached its annual goal. 
Analysts were generally upbeat about the numbers.
Ives Lauds ‘Major Achievement:’ Tesla’s Q4 deliveries of 484,507 units exceeded the Street estimate of 480,000 units and the whisper number of 478,000 units, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note. 
Production came in at 495,000 units, in line with Wedbush’s estimate but below the 500,000-plus units forecast by some, he said.
The production shortfall versus the expectations of some analysts reflected strong inventory control during the quarter, the analyst said. 
Model 3 and Y deliveries were strong at  477,000 units, with China a “clear area of success” he said.
“This was an important quarter for Tesla to show strong deliveries with clear momentum into 2024 as demand has upticked since 3Q based on all our global checks,” Ives said. 
“This was a clear win for Musk and Tesla as hitting 1.8 million vehicles for 23 was a major achievement with nice momentum into 24. Big year ahead for TSLA,” the analyst said.
Ives maintained an Outperform rating and $350 price target for Tesla stock.

Cramer stated, “My crystal ball suggests that profits will be taken from the best of the best, including the Magnificent Seven and friends, as well as the richly valued software enterprise names. I think investors will use that cash to invest in companies that haven’t gotten any respect for ages.”

New Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows tech stocks have fallen back into the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows tech stocks are near oversold.
The stock market has a consensus now that everything is going to be immaculate – the landing, the Fed, interest rates, earnings, adoption of AI, Russia, China, and the Middle East.
The stock market is assuming a 90% probability of seven rate cuts.
The stock market is going to face new economic data today:

ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 47.1%.
JOLTS report will be released at 10am ET.


The stock market will also face minutes from the last FOMC meeting at 2pm ET. Powell was dovish in the press conference, flipping 180 degrees. At The Arora Report, we will be reading the Fed minutes to see if the 180 degree flip was unanimous or if there was dissension.
If the new data and the Fed minutes are supportive of immaculate everything, expect a rip roaring rally and new highs.
If the data is not supportive of immaculate everything, expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to try to run up the stock market.
Market mechanics are neutral as of this writing in the premarket but can easily swing in either direction after the data and Fed minutes.
Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has made two key points this morning:

Rate hikes are not off the table.
The soft landing is at risk.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

Commenting on his statement, Silicon Valley Entrepreneur David Sacks, who is also a friend of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, said the president is trying to push businesses into “some archaic view of the past.”
What Happened: The president’s comments weren’t surprising, said Sacks while appearing on CNBC’s Last Call. “He of course he wants Tesla and Toyota and every other company in the world to be unionized,” the venture capitalist said.
“He’s probably the most union capture president we’ve ever had,” he added.
Sacks also recalled that the White House did not invite Tesla for the EV Summit it hosted. The snub was due to the fact that Tesla is not a union shop, he said, adding that the president chose to give credit for starting the EV revolution to companies such as General Motors Corp.

Wall Street Mechanics Kicking In 
Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows that TLT fell yesterday.
As we shared with you in the Afternoon Capsule, the reason for the fall in TLT was the poor Treasury auction. For details, see yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule.
Initially stocks fell on the poor Treasury auction, but the momo crowd bought the dip. Then came Powell’s statement that he was willing to raise rates if needed. The poor Treasury auction and Powell’s statement was a one-two punch that brought in more selling yesterday.
The chart shows that TLT is being bought this morning but still has a ways to go before reaching the lower resistance zone.
This morning Wall Street mechanics are kicking in, bringing in buyers in both stocks and bonds.
University of Michigan consumer confidence and inflation expectation data will be released at 10am ET. The data may be market moving.
The biggest data point ahead is CPI that will be released on November 14.
Remember that it is Friday, and short squeezes tend to occur on Fridays. In the early trade, there are signs of a short squeeze.
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents.   Please scroll down to see the protection band.

Here are the key events that happened in the EV space during the week:
Tesla India Rumors, Swedish Strike And More: The stalemate over Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) India foray continues, but reports suggested that India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal will likely meet Elon Musk in the U.S. next week. Goyal will reportedly discuss plans to set up a Tesla factory in India to manufacture the company’s $25,000 EVs. Musk will also likely push to cut the import duty on fully-built EVs from 100% to 15%.
Tesla is additionally facing labor union issues in Sweden, one of its key European markets. As Tesla mechanics began to strike, they were joined by dock workers affiliated with four powerful unions in the country. This has reportedly disrupted the unloading of Tesla’s vehicles. 
Following margin-squeezing price cuts, Tesla has opted to raise prices of its Model Y Long Range and refreshed Model 3 prices in China by 1,500 yuan ($206), according to its Chinese website.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Baron Investment Conference, billionaire investor Ron Baron said Tesla will  likely build its $25,000 EV within 18 months. “Wait 'til you see what's going to happen when all of a sudden they start ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Analyst Color', 'Equities', 'Asia', 'Top Stories', 'Media']",TSLA,0.034375,15:28:41,0.05299261000784687

Mack noted that, during a talk in 2001, Buffett had asked students at the University of Georgia two questions that would help them better understand the character traits they should adopt and  avoid. 
Mack pointed out that Buffett had asked the students which of their friends they would invest in and get 10% of their income for life.

Deploy Cash And Reduce Hedges
The trigger for the call to deploy cash and reduce hedges is two-fold:

Market mechanics of year end chase. This market mechanic results in money managers aggressively buying stocks even if their opinion of the stock market is bearish.
Lower than expected CPI.

Please scroll down to the Protection Band And What To Do Now section for the changes. The changes should be made in small tranches, especially if the stock market pulls back after this morning’s spike up.
CPI
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is ripping higher this morning on better than expected CPI.
The chart shows that the next target is the mini resistance zone.
The chart shows when hedges were reduced previously. The prior call was to deploy more cash. Now, there is a new call to deploy more cash and reduce hedges further.
RSI on the chart shows that the market is overbought. If the market pulls back due to overbought conditions, the pullback should be used to deploy more cash and reduce hedges.
CPI came better than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.1% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus.

Dot Plot
Please click here for the Fed’s prior dot plot.
Note the following:

The FOMC meeting is starting today. Tomorrow, the Fed will announce its decision at 2pm ET followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET.
The dot plot shows each FOMC participants’ projected mid point of the target for the federal funds rate. Each dot represents an FOMC participant.
The chart shows that no FOMC participants projected a federal funds rate of less than 5.125% in 2023.
The chart shows that one FOMC participant projected a federal funds rate above 6% in 2023.
The chart shows wide dispersion in 2024. The highest projection is 5.875%. The lowest projection is 3.625%.
In The Arora Report analysis, there is enough uncertainty in the economic data that the high end of the projection at 5.875% and the lower end of the projection 3.625% are both possible. This is why it is important for investors to start from Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading. Arora’s Second Law states, “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” It is important to not get locked into a bullish or bearish point of view. Consider flowing with the new data points. The Morning Capsules are your best source of new data points that matter. For the most part, you can ignore new data points that are not mentioned in the Morning Capsule.
The Fed is expected to release a new dot plot tomorrow.
The most important information from the Fed meeting will be the dot plot.
The consensus is that the Fed will have a hawkish statement but leave the rate unchanged.
Regarding the dot plot, momo gurus believe the dot plot will show as many as five interest rate cuts. This is the reason momo gurus are giving to urge their followers to aggressively buy stocks. The historical record is clear – momo gurus have consistently been wrong, yet being wrong does not stop momo gurus from making new projections and pretending that they know what the market will ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech']",TSLA,0.1250045913682277,14:52:28,0.2381963474274139

The analyst does not see Tesla any longer growing at its 50% a year ""mirage"" without a much cheaper car it will not have for years in a best-case scenario, and its Q3 results are also shaping up to be a big disappointment.
With Q3 cuts to list prices in the USA, China, Japan, and for the company's full-self-drive vaporware, as well as the analyst's observation that TSLA is increasingly selling units from inventory at discounted prices, it is his view that in addition to a ~1% incremental headwind to ASPs in Q3 quarter-over-quarter from list prices, there may be an additional ~1%-2% QoQ hit from inventory discounting. 
The upshot is that TSLA's reported Q3 ASPs may be down 2%-3% sequentially, more than the -2.0% he modeled.

A Terrible Milestone Reached
Please click here for a chart of U.S. national debt.
Note the following:

The chart shows the accelerating trajectory of the U.S. national debt.
The Treasury Department is informing that for the first time, gross national debt has exceeded $33T.
The chart shows that about $10T worth of debt has accumulated since the pandemic.
The national debt is likely to exceed $50T by the end of the decade if nothing substantial is done.
We are politically agnostic. Our sole job is to help investors by being objective.
Many federal programs passed by the Biden administration are costing more than expected. Here are two examples:

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was supposed to cost about $400B over 10 years. The reality is that it may cost more than $1T. The government simply underestimated the generosity of energy tax credits in the act.
The Employee Retention Credit was supposed to cost about $55B. It has already cost $230B. Recently, the IRS froze the program to stop fraud.


Estimates are that the Federal government will be paying over $10T in interest over the next decade.
For the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the federal deficit stands at $1.5T, a 61% increase over the same period last year.
The U.S. national debt equals over $254,000 per taxpayer.
In addition to the national debt, the government has unfunded liabilities. These liabilities now total over $193T. This equates to over $577,000 per U.S. citizen.
Prudent investors are concerned and are taking into account the rising national debt in their allocation.  
Momo gurus have convinced the momo crowd that the national debt and unfunded liabilities do not matter. Momo gurus keep urging their followers to ignore the debt and buy stocks.
Today is the second day of the Fed meeting.

The Fed will announce its rate decision at 2pm ET.
Powell’s press conference is at 2:30pm ET.
The consensus is no rate hike but a hawkish statement.

Ives, who has an Outperform rating and $350 price target on Tesla, said that the battle shows no signs of slowing down, with UAW President Shawn Fain ready to initiate more strikes at additional factory plants if a deal is not reached by Friday.

The comments come after the EV maker beat revenue and earnings per share estimates for the first quarter previously.
What Happened: A climb of Rivian shares in 2023 has led to a downgrade in rating from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard.
The analyst downgraded Rivian shares from Overweight to Neutral and increased the price target from $27 to $29.
Sheppard said Rivian’s production and delivery figures reported for the second quarter were ahead of estimates.
“This was a strong quarter, both relative to our estimates and vs. consensus,” Sheppard said.
One of the key takeaways from the company’s last quarterly earnings report for the analyst was the discussion of liquidity, with $11.8 billion available.
“More importantly, management reaffirmed during its 1Q call that it believes it is sufficiently funded ‘through 2025.’”
Another key factor for the analyst was Rivian appearing to end its exclusivity with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) for delivery vans. Amazon is the largest Rivian shareholder with a 17% stake according to the analyst.
“We expect the fulfillment of this agreement can generate a potential sales volume of $7.2B through 2032E.”
Rivian said its gross margins will be negative throughout 2023 with a gradual improvement that could lead to positive margins in 2024.

Wall Street was rattled by Fitch’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to AA+, aligning with S&P’s assessment.
Better-than-expected ADP employment report data for July failed to prevent a widespread sell-off affecting stocks, bonds, and commodities, with the only exception provided by the dollar’s performance in the foreign exchange market, signaling a growing demand for liquid assets.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
Major indices faced a significant tumble, with tech stocks showing the most weakness. The Nasdaq 100 experienced a notable 2.4% decline, on track for its largest daily drop in 2023.
Small caps in the Russell 2000 index fell by 1.8%, while the S&P 500 shed 1.4%. The Dow lost 240 points, down 0.7% for the session.

Long Yields Rise
Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows that long bonds are falling because yields on long bonds are rising. Bonds trade inverse to the yield.
The trendline on the chart shows that TLT had been making lower highs prior to the sudden drop.
The chart shows that TLT has now fallen below the prior support zone, which has now become the resistance zone.
The chart shows the next support zone.
RSI on the chart shows that TLT is way oversold. An oversold condition can lead to a quick bounce, but the bounce may not be sustainable in view of the huge supply of Treasury bonds. As a member of The Arora Report, you knew in advance that this was likely to happen due to increased borrowing by the U.S. We previously wrote:

In The Arora Report analysis, here is an important piece of new data that prudent investors should pay attention to. The U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it plans to borrow about $1T in the third quarter. This is the largest amount ever to be borrowed by the U.S. in any third quarter. More importantly, the amount to be borrowed is about $200B more than the prior estimates.


Along with the rise in yields on U.S. government bonds, yields on government bonds across the globe are rising.
Traditionally when yields rise, stocks fall. The reason is that stocks compete with bonds. When yields rise, bonds become more attractive.
Since technology stocks tend to be long duration stocks, historically, they are impacted negatively more than other stocks by rising yields. To develop an in-depth understanding of how it all works, listen to the podcast titled “Be Careful With Popular Long Duration Stocks.” In addition to this podcast, there are several other podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club that give you in-depth knowledge on the subject.
Rising yields were responsible for the significant drop in technology stocks and the bear market in 2022.
In 2023, investor exuberance over AI became so great that investors stopped caring about the yields. As a result, the historical relationship between stocks and bonds broke. Will the historical relationship reassert itself?

Oil Demand For Transport Fuels Is Predicted To Peak Sooner Rather Than Later
Road transport fuels, which have historically driven oil demand, will face significant challenges in surpassing pre-COVID-19 levels. The combination of energy efficiency improvements and substitution factors will exert a heavy burden on their growth prospects, according to IEA estimates.

The FOMC is largely expected to defer tightening interest rates at this meeting, snapping a streak of 15 consecutive hikes.
Both the S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 are on track to post their fifth straight session of gains. Wednesday also witnessed a lower-than-expected producer price inflation (PPI) print. The inflation measure fell from 2.3% in April to 1.1% in May, the lowest level since January 2020. 
Now, all eyes are on the FOMC policy statement, due at 2 p.m. ET, and Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. The Fed will also unveil its revised economic projections, which will give the board's assessment over interest rates, growth and inflation going forward. 
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
The S&P 500 index moved 0.2% higher, while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.4%, hitting levels last seen in early April 2022. 
Blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.4% and the small-cap-heavy Russell 2000 fell 0.3%.

Macro
In sharp contrast with this week’s Empire State Manufacturing Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s gauge of regional business activity dropped more than expected in April.


The index posted its eighth consecutive reading below zero—indicating a contraction—and its tenth in the past 11 months.


Subindexes for new orders are shipments both improved from the previous month but remain in contraction.


Prices paid by firms declined for the second straight month while prices received turned negative for the first time since May 2020.



Weekly initial jobless claims rose by 5,000 to 245,000—the highest since November 2021—pointing to a modest softening in the labor market.


It was the fifth time in 7 weeks that initial claims have been above 240,000.


Continuing claims rose to 22% above their levels from a year ago, above the 20% threshold that has historically marked a recession.



Sales of existing homes in the US fell more than expected in March, dropping 2.4%.


It was the 13th decline in sales in the last 14 months.


The median selling price for those homes fell by 0.9% from a year earlier to $375,000, marking the biggest drop since January 2012.



Meanwhile, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicator (LEI) continues to point to a recession ahead.


The LEI dropped 1.2% in March to its lowest level since November 2020.


On a YoY basis, the index fell 7.8%, a level not seen even during the recessions of the early 70s and early 80s.

A recession now looks like a foregone conclusion, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, citing the decline in the leading indicators index to the levels last seen in November 2020 when the economy was contending with the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Historically, an economic contraction has closely followed a decline in the LEI of this magnitude,” the economist said.

The commentary was mixed.
What Happened: The relationship between Trump and Musk has been somewhat muddled over the years and could continue to be a storyline ahead of the 2024 election.
During an appearance on the Full Send Podcast, Trump had praise for the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO. Given the opportunity to share only one word to describe Musk, Trump offered the following:
“Smart,” Trump said.
While not many would disagree with the notion Musk is incredibly smart, Trump’s commentary on electric vehicles may not be great for Tesla investors if Trump is reelected in the 2024 election.

Some positive earnings could serve to cushion any potential slide even as traders look ahead to the jobless claims report and Fed speeches for more clues toward the economic and rate outlook.
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: 
On Wednesday, the major averages ended mostly lower as a sharp rise in bond yields, exacerbated by the price component of the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ survey, and mixed earnings stifled any recovery attempt. The major indices opened lower but recovered in early trading. The S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite pulled back immediately after and languished below the unchanged line for the rest of the session.

The 30-stock Dow Industrials showed a lack of direction and flitted in and out of the unchanged line a few times before closing marginally higher. While the Dow bounced off a four-month low, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Index ended at their lowest levels since late January.
Most sectors, with the exception of energy, material and industrial stocks, came under selling pressure. Consumer discretionary, utility and real estate stocks were among the worst hit.

The Tesla Takeaways: The investor event provided an in-depth walkthrough of the manufacturing and production capabilities of Tesla and how it could improve costs, Narayan said.

For the fourth time in four years, the jackpot on the Mega Millions lottery drawing has topped the $1 billion mark.
Here’s a look at the historic jackpot and what you could buy with the after-tax lump sum winnings.
What Happened: The Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, is currently listed at $1.1 billion, which is the third-largest jackpot in the game’s history.
The $1.1 billion jackpot trails only the $1.537 billion won in 2018 and the $1.337 billion won in July 2022.
Tickets cost $2 to play with an additional $1 option cost for a multiplier that raises the nonjackpot winning payouts.
Five white balls are drawn numbered 1 to 70 and a gold Mega Ball numbered 1 to 25 is drawn. A person has to match all six to win the overall jackpot.
Players can select their own numbers for their tickets, with lucky numbers, birthdays and anniversaries often among the favorite selections. Players can also receive random numbers by selecting an easy pick/quick pick.
The overall odds to win the jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350. The odds to win a prize of at least $4 are 1 in 24.
If no one matched all six balls Tuesday night, the jackpot will increase ahead of a drawing on Friday, Jan. 13, 2022.
How Much Do You Win?: The jackpot for Tuesday’s drawing stands at $1.1 billion with a listed cash payment of $568.7 million.
The jackpot is paid out over a 30-year period with an initial payment upon winning and an annual payment for the next 29 years. Each annual payment goes up by 5% to attempt to offset inflation.
Given the current high inflation era that we are in, a person who wins the jackpot is immediately tasked with choosing whether they want all the money upfront or to be paid annually and if they think the 5% is enough to offset ...","['News', 'Penny Stocks', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Entertainment', 'Top Stories', 'Markets', 'General']",TSLA,0.19738095238095238,21:42:17,0.09701896646434482

Many began following Trump's account and are likely wondering why he hasn’t posted yet. An SEC filing might share some clues.
What Happened: Trump was banned in January 2021 from several social media platforms, including Twitter, due to the role he played in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump was reinstated to Twitter over the weekend, thanks to a move made by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter for $44 billion. 
Trump had already amassed more than 80 million followers on Twitter, significantly more than he has on the social media platform Truth Social, which belongs to his own company, Trump Media & Technology Group.
Investors in Digital World Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: DWAC), a SPAC with a pending merger with Trump Media & Technology Group, are likely concerned that Trump coming back to Twitter could hurt his own platform.

What Happened: After being banned by Twitter for more than two years, former President Donald Trump was welcomed back onto the social media platform that was acquired by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk for $44 billion.
The decision came after a poll was conducted by Musk on Twitter, which had been among the biggest topics of the weekend and Monday.
“Smart marketing move for Twitter. Now everyone comes to see what Trump does. Awful for Trump. The pressure is on him to entertain. Tweets hit different as the President vs now being TFG,” Mark Cuban tweeted, referencing Trump being ""the former guy.""
A Twitter user asked Cuban that if the business of Twitter was attracting advertisers, why would it bring Trump back to the platform?
“According to Elon that ship has already sailed. Maybe he thinks Trump will sell more $8 checks (it won’t). Or he just wants to show record user growth to investors and find a different way to monetize it?” Cuban answered.

The event is expected to begin at 8 p.m. ET and be likely live-streamed by Tesla’s official YouTube channel. It will also be covered in a live blog by Benzinga, alongside follow-up updates and reactions that can be found on the home page starting at 07:45 p.m ET.

Munster was referring to the 2007-08 global financial crisis that had its root in the housing market collapse. The market plunged amid the recession that ensued but bottomed in early 2019 before taking off. A broader uptrend was in play until the current down-leg began in November 2021.

(NASDAQ: TSLA) AI Day 2022 kicked off at 09:15 p.m. ET on Friday.
The event was live-streamed on the Tesla website and notable updates were related to the Optimus Tesla bot and the full self-driving software. 
CEO Elon Musk was hoping to use the event to hire the best AI talent who could drive innovation in that arena.
Find Benzinga’s detailed preview of the event here on what to expect.
The odd timing of the event has left Tesla bulls excited.
“No other company holds an event on a Friday night. I love it. Another example of Elon’s first principles approach,” Loup Funds’ Gene Munster said in a tweet.
Here were our live updates as the event unfolded:
09:10 p.m. EDT: The event is live and looks like it is a sold-out one; with over 30,000 watching as it is just getting started. Techno music is being played,  accompanied by visuals of some funky patterns that suit the theme of the event.
09:15 p.m. EDT: Alright, Musk is on stage and we are getting started — with robotic hands in the background hinting at Optimus.
09:20 p.m. EDT:  Musk gets started with a reference to Optimus and reminds people that Tesla is a public company. He jestingly remarks even he is not immune to firing, especially if he goes crazy. Musk says AI, Autopilot, Dojo and a 'long' question & answers session on the agenda — folks welcome to ask existential or technical questions — whatever floats their boat.
09:22 p.m. EDT: Tesla bot is on stage — a real one, a sleek looking one! It’s waving to the crowd now. So, we do have a prototype!

09:25 p.m. EDT: Musk says the bot can do more than what it's doing on stage. A video showing its other functionalities is presented, where the bot is seen working at the Fremont factory, watering plants among other things. Musk says the humanoid can identify objects. A bot with Tesla-designed actuators — Musk says it would be ready to walk in a few weeks.
09:30 p.m. EDT: Optimus can move fingers. The goal is to make it useful, Musk says. It is ""extremely useful"" and made in volume, probably in volumes. So, could cost less, about $20,000, according to Tesla.
09:33 p.m. EDT: Musk appreciates the team for doing a wonderful job but says still a lot of improvements to be made. He is appealing to talent to ...","['News', 'Events', 'Top Stories', 'Tech']",TSLA,0.1964320625610948,01:00:42,0.11076152371634729

The items that saw the biggest drops in confidence were the Supreme Court, losing 11 percentage points and coming in at 25%, and President Joe Biden’s job approval, losing 15 percentage points and coming in at 23%.
Americans were most confident in small business, which had 68% of people saying they had a great deal of confidence or quite a lot of confidence. The score for small businesses dropped two percentage points.
